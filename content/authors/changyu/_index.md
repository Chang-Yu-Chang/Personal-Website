Welcome!

- I am currently a PhD student in [Sanchez Lab](http://www.sanchezlaboratory.com/), working on questions like how microbial communities assemble or how to artifically select for communities with desired function.

- I like learning coding and digital tools that cut off tedious repetitive tasks and make life easy. For example, I enjoyed learning how to [make this website using blogdown](https://www.changyuchang.name/post/2018-03-08-how-to-build-up-this-website/) and [data-driven CV using pagedown](https://www.changyuchang.name/post/2019-11-03-data-driven-cv/). 

- While no working on desktop or bench, I like playing volleyball and cooking in my spare time. 

Here is my [CV](http://rpubs.com/ray57512/cyc-cv) and [resume](http://rpubs.com/ray57512/cyc_resume).
