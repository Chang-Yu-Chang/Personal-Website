- I am broadly interested in combining experiments and computational approaches to study biological phenomena. 

- In my PhD study, under the supervision of [Alvaro Sanchez](http://www.sanchezlaboratory.com/) and other amazing people in the lab, I am working on how to predicting microbial community assembly. Here are the [research projects](https://www.changyuchang.name/projects/) I am working on. 

- Besides research, I am very into the idea of data analysis and code reproducibility using R markdown. For example, I enjoyed learning how to [make this website using blogdown](https://www.changyuchang.name/2018/03/08/how-to-build-up-this-website/) and [data-driven CV using pagedown](https://www.changyuchang.name/2019/11/03/build-my-own-data-driven-cv/).
