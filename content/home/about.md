# Biography

Hi, I am currently a second-year Ecology and Evolutionary Biology PhD student at Yale University. I use mathematical modelling as well as lab experimental system to study microbial community assembly. 

Microbes are amazing organisms that show intricate interactions and versatile functions in a community context. Inspired by the great mind G. Evelyn Hutchinson, I am fascinated by questions like: 

- Why are there so many different kinds of microbes coexisting in a community?

- How do microbial communities adapt to their metabolites and emerge diverse functions?

- How to predict the community composition and functions across similar selective environments?
