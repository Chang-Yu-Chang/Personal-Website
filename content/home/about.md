# Biography

Microbes are amazing organisms that show intricate interactions and versatile functions in a community context. Inspired by the great mind G. Evelyn Hutchinson, I am fascinated by questions like: 

- Why are there so many different kinds of microbes coexisting in a community?

- How do microbial communities adapt to their metabolites and emerge diverse functions?

- How to predict the community composition and functions across similar selective environments?

As an PhD student working in [Alvaro Sanchez's Lab](http://www.sanchezlaboratory.com/), I use mathematical modelling as well as lab experimental system to study microbial community assembly. The projects that I am working on can be found [here](https://www.changyuchang.name/#projects). You can also check my [CV](/pdf/cyc-rmarkdown-cv.pdf).
