# Biography

Hi, I am currently a first-year PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Yale University. My interest broadly lines in the intersect of ecology and evolutionary biology. I came from a behavioral ecology background, where my senior and master theses mainly focus on the near-infrared (NIR) photoreception and its behavioral adaptation in burying beetles (*Nicrophorus nepalensis*). This experience shaped my standing points as thinking from a viewpoint of adaptationism.

Although no theorectical model directly used in this project, I was fascinated by the field that the general pattern of a biological system can be captured by neat mathematical equations. 

Microbes are amazing organisms that show intricate interactions but are also manipulable in lab. Generally, in microbial ecology, I am interested by the questions like: Why are microbial communities so diverse? How do they coexist in a limited resource environment? How do microbial community evolve such versatile functions and complex compositions?
