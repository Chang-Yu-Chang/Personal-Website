<p>I came across this tweet by Nick Strayer (<span class="citation">@NicholasStrayer</span>) on how to make a data-driven CV.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw this tweet, I decided to abandon <a href="https://www.changyuchang.name/2019/01/16/cv-online/">my latest CV made in latex</a> and change it to a cool data-driven CV! This is one of the most enjoyable moment using R to make (future) life easier, subsequent to indexing my Rmd files for data analysis.</p>

<p>The blog post by Nick was really thorough so I am not going to go through it. The data-driven CV is based on two packages <code>pagedown</code> and <code>tidyr</code>. <code>pagedown</code> enables the html to be printable in a nice pdf format, and <code>tidyr</code> gets together the cv information from a single csv file. Plus, great thanks to Nick that wrote the R functions communicating the CV data to a well-styled resume. For people with seriously terrible sense of art design, the template and default settings for the CV are really helpful.</p>
<p>Here is my <a href="http://rpubs.com/ray57512/cyc-cv">cv</a> and <a href="http://rpubs.com/ray57512/cyc_resume">resume</a>. The content is not fully compeleted yet, so I save the workflow for future CV updating:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Update <code>positions.csv</code> that saves all personal CV information in a tidy format with well-defined variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Knit the <code>cv.Rmd</code> and <code>resume.Rmd</code> with the parameter <code>PDF_EXPORT &lt;- TRUE</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Publish the knitted html on <a href="https://rpubs.com/">Rpub</a> to obtain the links. Export the local knitted html files into pdf format.</p></li>
<li><p>For updating website pdf links, move the pdf files to folder <code>static/pdf/</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Push git commit and deploy the website.</p></li>
</ol>
