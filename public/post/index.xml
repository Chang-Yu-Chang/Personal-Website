      <description>Run R on HPC Load R from module Install packages Run R script with arguments in command line  Run R in batch mode Node, core, and other jargons Submit the batch job Pipeline    I was trying to run simulation about my migration project on Yale HPC (high performance cluster). After spending a day working on how to do it, I think it’s probably a good time to take a note and dust off my website.</description>

      <description>Custom domain
 Commenting plug-in
  A quick update about new functions of this website. Two slight changes I have made: relocate the website to a customized domain, and enable the commenting function.
In case you want to know how this website was intially built, I wrote a guide. It’s a simple guide that contains other well-written tutorials and some caveats I’ve encounterd.
Custom domain Again, I found myself struggling with the terms for a while.</description>

      <description>Rcpp Generalized birthday problem GeneralBirthdayProblem package   In the previous post, I tried to use some algorithms to speed up simulation. Now in this post, I will introduce a pretty powerful package Rcpp, which has the potential to fundementally change the way you do simulation if you want to employ a time-consuming simulation in R. Let’s finish this project!

      <description>What’s probability of one birthday shared by two persons in any size of room? Binary search Replicate size   This tiny project comes from the coding class I am taking this semester. The simplest birthday problem is as followed: how many people should be in a room such that the probability of a birthday shared by at least two persons is just above 0.5? I found this problem is very interesting.</description>

      <description>Intro Tutorials Caveats I have jumped in  Intro The first (meaningful) post for this new website! After searching for many blog managers, I finally found out a cool and nice way to generate a good-looking website. The whole website is built under a R package blogdown, which is based on another pretty handy package rmarkdown that helps you markdown pdf or html file in Rstudio. blogdown employs a site generator called Hugo.</description>
