      <description>The first (meaningful) post for this new website! After searching for many blog managers, I finally found out a cool and nice way to generate a good-looking website. The whole website is built under a R package blogdown. This package is based on a site generator called Hugo. With that, there are numerous themes developed by other users. Some other features would be detailedly described in tutorials, here I wanna spent more time on the problems that I encountered during making the website.</description>
