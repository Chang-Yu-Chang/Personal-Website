      <description>Rcpp Generalized birthday problem GeneralBirthdayProblem package   In the previous post, I tried to use some algorithms to speed up simulation. Now in this post, I will introduce a pretty powerful package Rcpp, which has the potential to fundementally change the way you do simulation if you want to employ a time-consuming simulation in R. Let’s finish this project!

      <description>What’s probability of one birthday shared by two persons in any size of room? Binary search Replicate size   This tiny project comes from the coding class I am taking this semester. The simplest birthday problem is as followed: how many people should be in a room such that the probability of a birthday shared by at least two persons is just above 0.5? I found this problem is very interesting.</description>
